**Brief Overview**

We are addressing the challenge of integer recognition. We plan to use machine learning and data training (using data sets from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to create a classifier that can recognize handwritten digits. Our goals for the project are to use an SVM unsupervised machine learning algorithm to classify integer patterns. We will train our classifier on an integer training set and test it on an integer test set. We’d like to measure the accuracy of our classifier. Then, we’d be interested in expanding our project to include mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, etc) and greek letters. 

**Features List**

- Core Feature

Integer recognition -- We would like to recognize integers given an image of integers. We hope to do this using SVM (support vector machine). This way, our algorithm could be fed an image, do the math, and return the answer.

- Cool Extensions 

More functionality on integers (integrals, derivatives, etc.)-- This would be a direct extension on our core functionality. Other symbols we would like to recognize include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integrals, derivatives, square roots, exponentials, powers, and trigonometric functions. Again, our algorithm could be fed an image, do the math, and return the answer.
  
- Alphabet recognition of another language

The primary alphabet we have in mind is Greek. This fits in well with the general math theme that we have: we can now represent many variables used in various equations and computations.

- Recognize and convert into LaTeX

This would combine all of the above parts (recognition of integers, complex math symbols, and letters of the Greek alphabet). It would be incredible to feed our algorithm a picture of a PSET and have it spit out the LaTeX version.
